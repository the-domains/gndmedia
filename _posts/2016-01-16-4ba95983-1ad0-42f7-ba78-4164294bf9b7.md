Life and music

Funny how much could happen in nineteen years. 

Sabrina Francis has been singing all of her life. A talent
nourished from birth by her mother and role model Donysia Domerge, who is also
a singer and great songwriter, and her very supportive father, who loves music
as much as anybody else in her family. Mind you, she wasn

'

t
made to practice the piano 8 hours a day or write entire symphonies, but she
and at least four siblings were all taught how to appreciate the simple beat of
a drum, to savor the feeling that can come from a group of harmonized voices,
and to take pride in the gratification that can come from expressing yourself
with a pen.

Through-out the years, Sabrina has had a number of small but
memorable opportunities to share her voice with Grenada, she and her sisters
enjoyed singing together wherever they could and always had the welcomed
support of God, family, friends and even complete strangers.

A complete stranger was exactly what Dieter Burkhalter was to
Sabrina when they met in November of 2013, but he, with his love for music and
adventure, thought that she had something worth sharing. So step by step, song
by song, one encouraging speech after another, he was the one that convinced
her to devote serious time and energy into improving her talent, to do
something, anything with her voice, and knowing absolutely nothing of what the
future holds for her, that is exactly what Sabrina intends to do.
